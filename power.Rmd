## Cross-over Design

- 5 locations
- 3 scenarios each with 2 manipulations

```{r}
library(dplyr)

period1_treatments = c("A1","A2")
period2_treatments = c("B1","B2")
period3_treatments = c("C1","C2")
treatments = c(period1_treatments, 
         period2_treatments,
         period3_treatments)

d = expand.grid(p1 = treatments,
                p2 = treatments,
                p3 = treatments) %>%
  filter( substr(p1,1,1) != substr(p2,1,1) & 
            substr(p1,1,1) != substr(p3,1,1) & 
            substr(p2,1,1) != substr(p3,1,1) )
```
